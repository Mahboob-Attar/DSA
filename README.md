# ðŸ“˜ Recommended DSA Learning Order (Beginner-Friendly):


âœ… 1. Arrays & Strings

Basics, Traversal, Searching, Sorting

2-pointer problems

Sliding window (for slightly advanced prep)

Subarrays, Prefix sum

Time/space complexity


âœ… 2. Recursion

Print numbers, factorial, sum of array

Backtracking base cases

Patterns like:

Subset generation

Permutations

Palindrome partitioning

Then move to memoization (part of Dynamic Programming)


âœ… 3. Linked List

Basics, insertion, reversal

Detect loop, merge two lists, middle node


âœ… 4. Stacks and Queues

Stack using arrays or linked list

Balanced parentheses

Next greater/smaller element

Sliding window maximum


âœ… 5. Trees & Graphs

Binary Tree DFS, BFS

Tree recursion

Graph traversal: DFS, BFS


âœ… 6. Dynamic Programming (after recursion is clear)

Fibonacci with memo

Knapsack, LCS

Grid-based DP
