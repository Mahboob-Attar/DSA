# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) – Basic to Advanced Overview
🟢 Beginner Level (Basic Concepts)
📂 Data Structures:
1.Arrays – Fixed-size, indexed data structure.
2.Strings – Sequence of characters, often treated like arrays.
3.Linked List – Nodes connected via pointers (Singly, Doubly).
4.Stack – Last In First Out (LIFO).
5.Queue – First In First Out (FIFO).
6.HashMap / Dictionary – Key-value pair storage for fast access.

⚙️ Algorithms:
1.Searching – Linear Search, Binary Search.
2.Sorting – Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort.
3.Recursion – Function calling itself with base and recursive cases.
4.Basic Math – Prime numbers, GCD/LCM, Modular arithmetic.

🟡 Intermediate Level
📂 Data Structures:
1.Trees – Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST).
2.Heaps – Max-Heap, Min-Heap for priority operations.
3.HashSet / HashMap – Collision handling, hashing logic.
4.Two Pointers / Sliding Window – Optimized array/string problems.

⚙️ Algorithms:
1.Merge Sort / Quick Sort – Efficient divide-and-conquer sorting.
2.Backtracking – Sudoku solver, N-Queens problem.
3.Prefix Sum / Difference Array – Efficient range operations.
4.Bit Manipulation – XOR tricks, bit masking, counting bits.

🔴 Advanced Level
📂 Data Structures:
1.Graphs – Adjacency List/Matrix, Directed/Undirected, Weighted.
2.Tries – Efficient string/prefix storage.
3.Segment Tree / Fenwick Tree (BIT) – Range queries and updates.
4.Disjoint Set (Union-Find) – Cycle detection, Kruskal’s algorithm.

⚙️ Algorithms:
1.Dynamic Programming (DP) – Memoization, Tabulation, DP on Trees.
2.Greedy Algorithms – Huffman coding, Activity selection.
3.Graph Algorithms – BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall.
4.Advanced Recursion – DP with backtracking, combinatorics problems.
5.Topological Sort / SCC – DAG problems, Kosaraju’s algorithm.
